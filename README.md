A/B testing plays a critical role in decision-making processes across various industries. It is a method of comparing and testing the effectiveness and benefits of two (or more) different business strategies and finding the strategy that works best. Running A/B testing helps businesses save time and money that could have been wasted if the chosen strategy didn't work.


In marketing, A/B tests can be used in many areas:

1) improving email open rates,

2) advertisements on social media,

3)product recommendations on your web page,

4)testing different pictures or descriptions of your product and many more.


About data

A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

Goal
Evaluate A/B testing results from this dataset and decide which marketing strategy works the best and has statistically significant differences among the test groups.
